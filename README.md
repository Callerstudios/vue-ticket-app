## Project Overview

TicketApp is a **robust ticket management system** built in Vue.js. Users can:

- Log in and sign up (simulated via `localStorage` session token)
- View a dashboard with ticket statistics
- Manage tickets with full **CRUD** functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Receive **real-time feedback** via inline messages and toast notifications

The layout follows a **consistent design language** used across React and Twig implementations:

- Wave hero section on landing page
- Decorative circles and card-style components
- Max-width of 1440px, fully responsive design
- Color-coded ticket statuses: Open (Green), In Progress (Amber), Closed (Gray)
